When I was in high school, I never thought about majoring in mathematics. I thought I was more of social science person, but the experience I had in college changed my thoughts. I still remember one incident that I wrote a totally wrong answer to one of the problem sets, but I received a fairly good mark because professor thought the approach to the solution looked novel.\\
\bigskip
Ever since then, I liked thinking deeply about a math problem. I stayed late night at Lunt Hall or McCormick building, where I slipped into an empty classroom and wrote down math problems on the blackboard, stared at them for a while to find solution without looking back at solution manual.\\
\bigskip
This passion led me to become a math instructor/problem-solving coach at ReachPrep in South Korea. To these days, I still solve high-school competition math problems. Some questions are still hard, and others are not. I am particularly interested in teaching fundamental concepts used in competition math to younger students.\\

In October 2024, I read ``Dark Horse" written by Todd Rose. This archive is a project based on ``Dark Horse'' to see how much I progress through with what I like. The level of difficulty for these problems is either early AIME or last seven problems in AMC 10 or 12.\\
