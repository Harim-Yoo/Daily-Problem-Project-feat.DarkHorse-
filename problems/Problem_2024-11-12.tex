\begin{problem}
Given positive real numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, if $(a+c)(b+d)=121$, determine the least value of $a+b+c+d$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
According to AM-GM inequality, 
\begin{align*}
    \dfrac{(a+c)+(b+d)}{2} & \geq \sqrt{(a+c)(b+d)}\\
    \dfrac{a+b+c+d}{2} & \geq \sqrt{121}\\
    a+b+c+d &\geq 2(11)\\
    &\geq 22
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Given three positive integers $a>b>c\geq1$, let $N$ be the number of triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $a+b+c=331$. Find the last three digits of $N$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Stars-and-bars imply that the total number of triples without condition equals $\binom{333}{2}$. Assume that $a=b>c$. Then, $2a+c=331$. Diophantine equation shows $166$ triples. Arrange $166$ triples by $\frac{3!}{2!}=3$ ways. Hence, subtract $498$ from $55278$ to retrieve $54780$. The answer is $780$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Compute the number of sequences that are arrangements of the numbers $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$ and satisfy the requirement that no term in the sequence is larger than or equal to the square of the next term.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
First, $1$ should stay in the front of the sequence. Notice that $1<2^2$, $3<2^2$ and $4=2^2$. Hence, we only allow $12$ or $32$ as two consecutive terms in the sequence. Arrange $3$, $4$, and $5$, in $3!(=6)$ ways. Then, place $2$ next to either $1$ or $3$, in $2!(=2)$ ways. Therefore, there are $12$ sequences satisfying the given condition.
\end{solution}
